## Description

I thought that it was the most poetic to represent the origin of our life, and I think that the relationships between two objects, such as co-evolution, that are stimulated and influenced by each other, are those that represent the origin of our current life.
Looking at the coronavirus, which is one of the things that has the greatest impact on us humans these days, humans are researching vaccines and therapeutics to protect themselves from the coronavirus, and the virus responds to it by self-replicating process in order not to lose the human, the target of the host. It shows how the two relationships are closely influenced and evolved, as if they were created by themselves in the form of stronger mutations.
Also, when looking at the relationship between art and technology, as it is said that technology is the source of art and art inspires technology, they interact with each other and constantly evolve.
In this way, from the past, we have developed so as not to be slaughtered in the constant exchange of influences, and since it was a continuation of this, wouldn't the give-and-take relationship become the source of human life? I thought.
So, if the organic relationship between two objects that influence each other and cannot be separated can be expressed through visual monotony, how can it be expressed simply?
